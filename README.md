# ELSE Conference 2020 Use Case: Enhancing Colposcopy Through Deep Learning

The use case is aimed at students, enthusiasts of artificial intelligence, developers and bioengineers. The use case presents a real application in the field of medical image processing and along the way introduces the reader to the main concepts of deep learning. 
Everything is developed in Python and uses a Jupyter notebook, which should be run in Google Colab. The main framework used is PyTorch. All these are important tools to be mastered by someone studying deep learning.

This use case has been presented in the 16th International Scientific Conference in eLearning and Software for Education (also known as eLSE) in Bucharest, Romania, between the 30th of April and the 1st of May, 2020.
